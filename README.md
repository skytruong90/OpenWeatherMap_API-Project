# Title: Forcasting Weather
### This program will use the OpenWeatherMap API to get the weather data and then display it to the user.

## How to use this:
To use this program, you'll need to sign up for a free API key from OpenWeatherMap and replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your own API key in the code.

When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter a city name. After you enter a city name, the program will make an API request to OpenWeatherMap to get the weather data for that location. It will then extract relevant weather information from the response and display it to the user.

Note that this program only provides current weather data for a specific location. To create a more advanced weather forecasting system, you would need to collect and analyze historical weather data, use machine learning models to make predictions, and display forecasts over a longer period of time.
